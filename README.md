# CSCI-5502-Data-Mining
This project is about analyzing the PERM(Program Electronic Review Management) dataset. The PERM dataset contains information about the occupations of foreign workers, industry, salary range, applicant's educational qualifications, and so on. Using this dataset, we will analyze the tendency of each region to attract foreign workers, how education level and work experience correlate with the success rate of applications, and Which industries or occupations have the highest demand for foreign workers, focusing on revealing how global economic changes are impacting the demand for foreign labor in specific sectors, and identifying the skills that are becoming increasingly important in the U.S. labor market.
